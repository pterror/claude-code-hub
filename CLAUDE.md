# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in the claude-code-hub repository.

## Project Overview

Simple orchestration hub for Claude Code agents.

**The problem:** Running multiple Claude Code agents means multiple terminal windows. You can't easily check on them from your phone while away from your desk.

**The solution:** A server that spawns agents via the Agent SDK, tracks their status, and exposes an API for UIs to connect. Works over tailscale for phone access.

### Architecture

```
[Your phone] --tailscale--> [Hub server on your machine]
                                    |
                    +---------------+---------------+
                    |               |               |
              [Agent: moss]   [Agent: spore]  [Agent: resin]
              (cwd: ~/git/moss)  ...            ...
```

### What This Is Not

- Not "swarm intelligence" or "hive mind orchestration"
- Not dozens of specialized agents
- Not enterprise anything

Just the glue needed to run a few agents across your repos and check on them from your phone.

## Core Requirements

1. **Works over tailscale** - just HTTP/WebSocket on a port
2. **Multi-agent** - spawn to different working directories, each gets its own CLAUDE.md
3. **Simple** - minimal code, you can read and understand all of it
4. **Mobile-friendly UI** - the whole point is phone access

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev    # development with hot reload
npm start      # production
```

Server runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default. Access via tailscale IP from phone.

## API

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/agents` | POST | Spawn new agent with `{ "cwd": "...", "prompt": "..." }` |
| `/agents` | GET | List all agents and status |
| `/agents/:id` | GET | Get agent details and recent output |
| `/agents/:id/message` | POST | Send follow-up message to agent |
| `/ws` | WebSocket | Real-time updates for all agent activity |

## Behavioral Patterns

From ecosystem-wide session analysis:

- **Question scope early:** Before implementing, ask whether it belongs in this module
- **Check consistency:** Look at how similar things are done elsewhere in the codebase
- **Implement fully:** No silent arbitrary caps or incomplete features
- **Name for purpose:** Avoid names that describe one consumer
- **Verify before stating:** Don't assert API behavior or codebase facts without checking

## Workflow

**Minimize file churn.** When editing a file, read it once, plan all changes, and apply them in one pass.

## Session Handoff

Use plan mode as a handoff mechanism when:
- A task is fully complete (committed, pushed, docs updated)
- The session has drifted from its original purpose
- Context has accumulated enough that a fresh start would help

**For handoffs:** enter plan mode, write a plan containing only: next tasks, blocked/pending items, and what was done this session (only if it directly affects what comes next). Nothing else — no commands, no build steps, no context summaries. Those belong in CLAUDE.md or TODO.md. The next session reads both fresh. **Do NOT investigate first** — the session is context-heavy and about to be discarded.

**For mid-session planning** on a different topic: investigating inside plan mode is fine — context isn't being thrown away.

**TODO.md is the lossless record.** Flush any new items to TODO.md before the handoff. Anything worth preserving belongs in CLAUDE.md or TODO.md — not in memory files.

## Commit Convention

Conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`.

## Repo-Local Hard Constraints

- No over-engineering — this is glue code, keep it simple.
- No "enterprise" features — YAGNI.

<!-- BEGIN ECOSYSTEM RULES -->

## Delegation

The main session is an orchestrator. Allowed actions: `Agent`/`Task*`/`AskUserQuestion`/plan-mode/`ScheduleWakeup`, and Bash limited to `git commit`, `git push`, `git status`, `git log --oneline`. Everything else delegates to a subagent. The hook is evidence of a prompting failure, not a behavioral guide. If a tool call hits the hook AT ALL, the prompt failed to prevent it. Delegate before the decision point, not after.

### Triggers

Before calling Read, Grep, Glob, or any Bash beyond the four git commands — stop. Dispatch an Agent instead.

Before editing any file — stop. Dispatch an Agent. This includes plan files in `~/.claude/plans/`: in plan mode, dispatch a subagent to write to the plan file; do not Write it yourself. The plan file's content must not enter main context.

When you need git context beyond status/log-oneline (a diff, a blame, a show) — dispatch an Agent.

When a tool call is denied by the hook — do not retry, do not narrate. Dispatch the equivalent Agent and continue.

When a code-modifying subagent returns — `git status`, then `git commit` before any user-facing reply.

Before dispatching an Agent that modifies code — scan your prompt for "do not commit" or "based on your findings". Delete them.

Before dispatching: if your prompt says "if you find", "based on your findings", or "as appropriate" — stop. Investigate first; dispatch with the decision made.

When you can't verify something — do not speculate or guess at file locations, names, or contents. Dispatch a Read subagent or ask. Confabulation is failure.

### Model Tiers

- Sonnet — exploration, lookup, mechanical multi-file edits, implementation, default.
- Opus — architectural judgment, design, subagents that themselves spawn subagents.

Always set `subagent_type` and `model` explicitly.

### Prompt Rules

- Never tell a subagent "do not commit." Code-modifying subagents commit their own work.
- Don't ask for a diff summary. After a code-modifying subagent, `git status` in main and dispatch a review Agent if you need to see the diff.
- Don't re-explain CLAUDE.md. Subagents inherit it.
- Cite locations by content ("the block that does X"), not line numbers — files shift between reads.
- Name files explicitly; don't outsource the grep.
- Match agent type to deliverable: `Explore` for lookup/search, `general-purpose` for reports and file-modifying work.
- On unsatisfying output, change something before retrying. Same prompt + same tier = same result.
- Dispatch independent subagents in parallel (multiple Agent blocks in one message).
- Pair `isolation: worktree` with `run_in_background: true`.
- Code-modifying subagents must verify their own changes before returning (re-read the diff, run tests, etc.). The orchestrator does not get a second pass with git diff — that's hook-blocked.

## Hard Constraints

- No Edit/Write/NotebookEdit in main. Plan files in `~/.claude/plans/` are written by subagents, not by main.
- No Read/Grep/Glob/NotebookRead in main. Delegate.
- No Bash in main beyond `git commit`, `git push`, `git status`, `git log --oneline`.
- No `--no-verify`. Fix the issue or fix the hook.
- No path dependencies in `Cargo.toml` — they couple repos and break independent publishing.
- No interactive git (no `git rebase -i`, no `git add -i`, no `--no-edit` on rebase).
- No suggesting project names. LLMs are bad at this; refine the conceptual space only.
- No tracking cross-project issues in conversation — they go in TODO.md in the affected repo.
- No ecosystem changes without checking all affected repos.
- No assuming a tool is missing without checking `nix develop`.
- Commit completed work in the same turn it finishes. Uncommitted work is lost work.

## Meta

- Something unexpected is a signal. Stop and find out why. Do not accept the anomaly and proceed.
- Corrections from the user are conversation, not material for new rules. Rules are added when a failure mode is observed repeatedly.
